# Pokémon Battle Mini Project

## Overview

This is a simple Python command-line game that uses the **PokéAPI** to fetch Pokémon data and simulate a battle between a player and the CPU.

The project focuses on:

- Using a public API in Python
- Working collaboratively with Git and GitHub

## How It Works

- Pokémon data is retrieved from the PokéAPI
- The player chooses a Pokémon (or is assigned one at random)
- The CPU is assigned a random Pokémon
- A battle is simulated using Pokémon stats
- A winner is declared

## Project Structure

```text
pokemon_game/
  api.py      # Handles all API requests and data formatting
  battle.py   # Contains the battle and game logic
  main.py     # Runs the game and handles user interaction
```

## How to Run
